Macaroni Engine is an OpenGL game engine that abstracts the raw OpenGL code and makes writing an OpenGL app much simpler.

Macaroni Engine uses GLEW, GLFW, and STBI.

To install all required libraries, run the install.sh script by running the command "./install/install.sh".

The install script uses the Homebrew package manager. If you would like to unsintall homebrew, the command is:
"/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)""

After you write your code in main.cpp, to compile, run the command: "make" to run the Makefile that will compile the code!.

Running "./app" will run the executable!

If you have any questions please create an issue on the GitHub repo.
